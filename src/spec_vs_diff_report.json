SEO metadata and sitemap entry were added, and the page was explicitly kept out of the main navigation. Due to file truncation, some content/section and CTA repetition acceptance criteria cannot be fully verified from the diff summary.",

      "reason": "The added landing page file is truncated; only the Hero section and the beginning of a 'Challenges' section are visible. The required additional sections and their distinct structure cannot be confirmed from the provided diff excerpt.",
