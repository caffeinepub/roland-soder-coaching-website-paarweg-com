      "reason": "The diff for ZurichCouplesLandingPage.tsx is truncated and the shown portion focuses on adding document.title and multiple meta/canonical/Open Graph tags; it does not show the “Wenn die Beziehung feststeckt” section nor the specific string replacement, so the acceptance criteria cannot be verified from the provided evidence.",
