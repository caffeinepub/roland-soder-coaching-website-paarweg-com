  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to BaselCouplesLandingPage.tsx that add a hero image section and update the layout structure. However, the diff is truncated and does not show the complete implementation, making it difficult to fully verify all requirements. Based on the visible changes, REQ-2 (hero image) appears to be implemented with the image path '/assets/generated/basel-hero', but the verification of REQ-1 (complete layout alignment with Zürich page) cannot be completed due to truncation.",

      "reason": "The diff is truncated and only shows the hero section of BaselCouplesLandingPage.tsx. Cannot verify if all sections (arrangement, spacing, content hierarchy) match the Zürich page structure throughout the entire component.",
